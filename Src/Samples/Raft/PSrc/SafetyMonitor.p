// Election safety: at most one leader can be elected in a given term.
// Leader Append-Only: a leader can only append new entries to its logs (it can neither overwrite nor delete entries).
// Log Matching: if two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all entries up through the given index.
// Leader Completeness: if a log entry is committed in a given term then it will be present in the logs of the leaders since this term
// State Machine Safety: if a server has applied a particular log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log.
